 *  You are given a library with n words(w[0], w[1], ..., w[n-1]), you choose a word from it and in each step, remove one letter
 *  from this word only if doing so yields another word in library. What is th longest possible chain of these removal steps?
 *  For example, you are given "a", "b", "ba", "bca", "bda", "bdca"
 *  the length of chain is 4 "bdcd"-->"bca"-->"ba"-->"a". For a better answer to exist, the length of the selected first word
 *  should be greater than 4. In our test case, such a word does not exist.
